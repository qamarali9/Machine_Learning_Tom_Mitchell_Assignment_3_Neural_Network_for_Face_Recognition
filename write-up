In 'imagenet.c' encoded each ouput to be length 20(+1) vector, with only one of the values as HIGH(=0.905) and rest LOW(=0.005); each userid is mapped to a number between 1-20 corresonding to the order in which it is mentioned in the assignemnt and that element/co-ordinate of the output vector will be set to HIGH

Yes, the hidden units seem to weight particular regions of the image greater than others e.g, hidden unit 4 weighs face(forehead and chin) facing right more than other regions.
Yes, particular hidden units seem to be tuned to different features of some sort e.g, hidden unit 5 seems to be tuned to detect face facing straight while hidden unit 4 weighs seems to be tuned to detect face facing right.
